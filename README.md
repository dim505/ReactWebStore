# ReactWebStore

I seperated my app into 2 folders. The front end folder will contain my React JS front end and the back end folder will contain my ASP.NET API endpoint.

I am developing a webstore that will have a React JS front end, ASP.Net API for the backend and it will connect to a SQL database.

Please see my Web store live: https://reactwebstore.azurewebsites.net (Please note it is still being developed at the moment)
