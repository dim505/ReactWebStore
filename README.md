# ReactWebStore

Folder Structure:
Client App > SRC  (This is where all the JavaScript files for the React JS front end lives)

I am developing a webstore that will have a React JS front end, ASP.Net API for the backend and it will connect to a SQL database.

Please see my Web store live: https://reactwebstore.azurewebsites.net (Please note it is still being developed at the moment)
